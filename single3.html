										<h2><a href="#">How this course have treated me</a></h2>
									</div>
								</header>
								<span class="image featured"><img src="images/learn.png" alt="" /></span>
								<p align="justify">
									This course have given me numerous things that I have yet to discover, well considering the fact that I specifically chose this course know that this will somehow 
									be my line of work in the future. But still, this course offered many concepts that would help me work my way up on my goals becoming a decent Computer Engineer.
								</p>
								<p align="justify">
									In this course, I have learned the different software applications that would aid the administrators in managing different types of servers depending on the system 
									it is assigned on, some of these applications is called Ansible, in which it is an open-source tool that enables the development of Infrastructure as a Code (IaaC), 
									monitoring, and utilizing alerting in the Development Operation environment while simultaneously collaborating with Git and GitHub, which is a control system that 
									tracks new changes, merges, synches, clones, and compares the user's codes. Through this application, we students have learned the concept of playbooks and how to 
									construct our own playbook. This is somehow the center and focus of every discussion and activities that we have been encountered althroughout the course. It is 
									given that the activities that are needed to be done can be hard and complex as there are different syntax on each and every operating system. Another concept have 
									also been introduced to us to pair it up with playbooks which is called Containterizaiton, since the contained application is an isolated user space-sharing in an OS 
									and can transfer its data from one environment to another without errors, containerization technologies, a type of operating system virtualization, also known as "portable 
									computing environments," enable developers to deploy and create applications securely. 
								</p>
								<p align="justify">
									Last main concept that have been though to us is using the diffeent Cloud Services considering that businesses frequently utilize cloud services to deliver services by 
									helping clients' incoming data with flexibility to keep up with the current demand and supply from high to low without wasting and failing the cloud's resources, as well 
									as the money of both the client and the supplier. Due to its open-source cloud computing operating system and its components, including Horizon, Nova, Neutron, Cinder, 
									Keystone, and more, OpenStack is one of the Cloud Services that is primarily used by Administrators, IT professionals, and students to hone their skills by controlling 
									their respective data inputted to the cloud.
